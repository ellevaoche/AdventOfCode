## Years

### [2025](./2025/README.md)
My contributions to the 2025 exchange. For this year, I took on the "Polyglot" challenge, solving each day's puzzle in a different programming language (Lua, Go, TypeScript, Java, Python, etc.).

### [2023](./2023/README.md)
Java solutions from 2023. These were migrated from legacy Maven projects and are verified to work with the standard inputs.
