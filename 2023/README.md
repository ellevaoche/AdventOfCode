# Advent of Code 2023 - Java Solutions

This directory contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges.

**Note**: These files were migrated from a Maven project structure. They are raw Java source files and may require simple setup (like default package or manual compilation) to run standalone, as the original `pom.xml` dependencies (e.g., Lombok) are not included here.

## Structure

Each day is organized into its own folder:

- `DayXX/`
  - `DayXXPart01.java`: Solution for Part 1.
  - `DayXXPart02.java`: Solution for Part 2.
  - `DayXX.txt`: Puzzle input.
