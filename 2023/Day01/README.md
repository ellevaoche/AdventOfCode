# Day 1: Trebuchet?!

Global snow production is down. To restore it, you need to solve puzzles.

## Part 1

**Task:** The calibration document has lines of text. On each line, the calibration value is found by combining the **first digit** and the **last digit** (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.

**Goal:** What is the sum of all of the calibration values?

Example:
```text
1abc2       -> 12
pqr3stu8vwx -> 38
a1b2c3d4e5f -> 15
treb7uchet  -> 77
Sum: 142
```
