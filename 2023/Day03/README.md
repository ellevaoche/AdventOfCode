# Day 3: Gear Ratios

You have an engine schematic full of numbers and symbols.

## Part 1

**Task:** Any number adjacent to a symbol (even diagonally) is a "part number". Periods (`.`) do not count as a symbol.

**Goal:** What is the sum of all of the part numbers in the engine schematic?

Example:
```text
467..114..
...*......
```
467 is adjacent to `*` -> Part Number.
114 is not -> Not a Part Number.
